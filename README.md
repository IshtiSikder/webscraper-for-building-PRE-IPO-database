# webscraper-for-building-PRE-IPO-database

Pre-IPO refers to the act of companies selling a portion of their stocks before going public. Provided a list of possible companies going pre-IPO, this scraper uses google chrome to scrape key information about said companies (i.e official website address, wikipedia page, linkedin page, crunchbase page) for investors to evaluate them for investment. This scraper was built as a project under Crediblock, which is a local fintech company at Charlotte, NC, USA ; to help develop a pre-IPO database for their website.
